### Contactually

 Contactually is an online database for your contacts. Built in React and Ruby on Rails. Accompanying specs written in [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core). Allow a user to upload a comma-delimited file of contacts via a web form. The
  file will contain the following columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email_address`,
  `phone_number`, `company_name`. There's an example file included (data.csv).
